A highly documented plugin that demonstrates how to create custom AJAX admin list-tables using official WordPress techniques.

== Description ==

Custom AJAX List Table Example is a WordPress Plugin example of WP_List_Table AJAX implementation. It is a fork of Matt Van Andel's Custom List Table
Example plugin.

This plugin serves as a highly documented example of using WordPress's built-in WP_List_Table class for plugin development. Previously, WordPress plugins
had to be created from scratch and were often wildly inconsistent with the rest of the WordPress admin. This example serves to help clarify use of the
WP_List_Table class for quickly and easily generating consistent, standardized, feature-rich list-tables for WordPress admin screens.

One new admin menu is created: "List Table Example". This page includes an example table and all the documentation needed to reproduce it. Developers who
open the PHP file itself will find exceptionally well documented code outlining all the information needed to duplicate this feature.
